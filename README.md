A simple simple app I made for my first son's baby shower.

It allows:

- Guest registration with just their name
- Access a predefined suggested gifts list
- Select what gifts to take
- Unselect gifts if the guest changes his/her mind
- Only the guest who selected a gift can un-select it
- It doesn't implement password registration because it has to be simple and easy to use. Registration with password tends to be much of a hassle for a baby shower. Identity theft in this scenario doesn't cause much or any damage and it is very unlikely in short-life apps like this. Anyway, it can be implemented.
- If two users register with the same name, the first wins the slot.
- Registration names are case insensitive.
- Guests with selected gifts can see a list of them.
